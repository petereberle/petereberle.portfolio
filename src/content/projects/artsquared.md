ArtSquared is an annual community art show and sale that serves as [ArtWalla's](https://artwalla.com/) primary fundraiser. Due to COVID-19 guidelines, ArtWalla decided not to host a physical event, so I was asked to create a standalone online store to showcase 130 participating artists. I worked closely with the ArtSquared committee to translate the hallmarks of the annual event into a virtual experience.

We decided that the site must be unique to ArtSquared, easy to use, and remarkable. To that end, finding the right platform would make all the difference. I selected Wordpress with Woocommerce for its extensibility and vast plugin library. The site runs on a custom child theme paired with Elementor's editor UI for easy content management. 

Over the course of opening week, the store generated more than $25,0000 in sales and sold 70% of inventory.
