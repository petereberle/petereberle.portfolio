[ArtWalla](https://artwalla.com/) was in need a major facelift to their organization and membership site. I created a custom theme and information organizing strategy to update their web presence and provide an easy interface for ArtWalla members to access their online profiles. The custom theme integrates with the pre-existing WildApricot membership platform to fetch and display member information.

After implementing the new site, ArtWalla saw an increase in site traffic and membership applications performed online.

WildApricot, ArtWalla's membership and hosting platform, took notice of the site and featured ArtWalla in its monthly [organization spotlight](https://www.wildapricot.com/blogs/newsblog/2020/07/27/july-update-2020).
