At the climax of our self-destructive relationship with nonhuman sites and bodies, *Alluvium* recalls a dissociated image of a floodplain, a source of vital soils and nourishing waters, and renders a barren, facsimiled landscape in its place. Echoes of topographic and stratigraphic systems are reproduced through the precise logic of industrial cement casting, a process designed to cover swaths of excavated land in a repeated rock face or texture, camouflaging inherent destruction. With its contrived technique laid bare, fallible, and delicate, Alluvium craves a new tenderness, if possible, between humans and nature.

*Alluvium* was exhibited in the [Whitman College 2020 Virtual Senior Art Thesis Show](https://sheehangallerythesisshow2020.com). The original project plans were intended for large scale installation in the Sheehan Gallery, but due to the advent of COVID-19 campus shutdowns, I completed a limited version of my thesis at home.
