[BAMP (Boise All Ages Movement Project)](http://www.boiseallagesproject.org/) is a nonprofit dedicated to establishing an all-ages, inclusive community space and music venue. BAMP asked [One Stone's](https://onestone.org/two-birds) student design interns to create a new logo that would better capture the energy of their growing organization. The final image is collaboration between myself and another student intern.

**Technologies:** InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop
