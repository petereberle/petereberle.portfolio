ArtWalla's [First Friday Art Tour](https://artwalla.com/art-tour) is a monthly event from April through October. One of the tour's highlights is an ArtWalla member PopUp show that features their recent work. However, due to COVID-19 guidelines, ArtWalla had to transition to a virtual event.

To make the leap to an all virtual event, I created a simple filtered grid index and individual pages to showcase each artist. I also streamed live artist talks to social media that accompanied the debut of these pages.
