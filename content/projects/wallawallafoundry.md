[Walla Walla Foundry](https://wallawallafoundry.com) is a leading contemporary art fabricator and casting facility known for its monumental sculpture capacity and cutting-edge techniques. The Foundry serves world-renowned artists, such as KAWS, Takashi Murakami, and Hank Willis Thomas.

Shortly after joining the project management team at Walla Walla Foundry, ownership took notice of my previous experience as a web developer for art-centered organizations in the Walla Walla Valley and asked me to design layout proposals for a new website. We decided on a minimal UI that showcases the Foundry's project portfolio through in-house photography and video.

Given the small footprint of the selected design, I opted for a headless CMS and a static site generator. I selected Hugo as the SSG for its quick development turnaround and ability to render from markdown content. Decap CMS paired well as a markdown generator due to its customizability and simple client interface.
