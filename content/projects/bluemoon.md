"blue moon" is a Whitman College art and literature magazine produced by student volunteers. I served as Layout & Digital Media Editor during the 2019-2020 academic year. During layout week, I coordinated a team of student editors and staff members to build volume 33 in Adobe InDesign. Together, we redesigned the magazine's layout, font hierarchy and integrated graphics.

**Technologies:** InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop
