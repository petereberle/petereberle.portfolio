The Dia de Los Muertos Festival is annual event in downtown Walla Walla, Washington, that celebrates the Latin American tradition of its namesake. I worked with the festival coordinator, Katy Rizzuti, to research a site builder that would allow her to easily update content every year the festival was held. Katy asked that I use Squarespace because of its simple admin interface.

Since the festival spanned two days and different locations, I prioritized easy, clear navigation. I also created custom graphics and icons to deliver a unique art direction.

The site uses a modified Squarespace template and custom HTML/CSS components. Unfortunately, the festival was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19, so it is now largely defunct. 

**Technologies:** HTML, CSS, Squarespace, Illustrator
